  <h3>How it works</h3>
  <p>Users of RPM-based Linux distributions (such
  as <a href="http://opensuse.org">openSUSE</a>
  or <a href="http://fedoraproject.org">Fedora</a>) provide
  weekly <a href="/FAQ#anonymity">anonymous</a> information about the
  packages they have installed. This is done by simply installing the
  <strong>popcorn-client</strong> package on their machines.</p>

  <p><strong>popcorn-client</strong> collects basic metadata about a
  participating user's system and all their installed packages. It also
  figures out when those packages were last used and splits them into
  four categories: <em>recent</em>, <em>old</em>, <em>voted</em>
  or <em>nofiles</em>. Once a week it sends this data to the popcorn
  server (here). Read more about the popcorn-client <a href="#">here</a>.
  </p>

  <p>The <strong>Popcorn server</strong> receives the data sent
  by <strong>popcorn-client</strong> and stores it in a database. We
  don't track user IPs or even the history of a system's installed
  packages over time. It then makes this data available to everyone
  through <strong>charts</strong> (like the ones above and on the
  various API documentation pages) and a <a href="/api">RESTful API</a>
  (for other services to use).</p>

  <h3>Why?</h3>
  <p>Linux distributions are built from open source packages. But there
  are a lot of them and people resources are often very
  limited. Figuring out which packages our users really use would help a
  lot with prioritising tasks. It's also good to know that someone uses
  that package you were up all night trying to build.</p>

  <p>There are a lot of questions that Linux distributions ask
    themselves: from things as simple as figuring out what CPU
    architectures people are using to more specialised questions like:
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Should we bother to package gems as RPMs or is everyone installing
      them as gems anyway?</li>
    <li>Is anyone actually using python3 at this point?</li>
    <li>How long do people use an old distribution release for after
    we've declared it End of Life?</li>
  </ul>

  <h3>How you can help</h3>
  <p>The best way to help right now (and the easiest) if you're an
  RPM-based Linux distribution user is to <strong>install
  popcorn-client</strong> and then forget about it. It will send us the
  data we need to make your distribution better for you.</p>

  <p>If you're a developer you might want to check
  out <a href="http://github.com/opensuse/popcorn">the sources</a> and
  hack something on the server. It's mostly python under an MIT
  license. Look for bugs in our <a href="">issue tracker</a> or think up
  new features.</p>

  <p>If you want to develop a third party service, go ahead and look at
  the <a href="/api">API</a>.</p>

  <p>If you have a question that you think popcorn's data might be able
  to answer and you can't find the answer by looking at all our crazy
  graphs, <a href="/contact">contact us</a> and we'll try to figure out
  an answer for you.</p>
