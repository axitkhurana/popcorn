Introduction
------------

Popcorn lists system packages and for each package it reads access time of its
"watched" files (see section Watched Files below). The most recent fileaccess
time is considered as the "package access time". The packages are then split into
four categories depending on the package install time and package access time:

* (r) recent
  - package has been recently installed (less than 30 days)
  - ( now - install_time < 30 days )
* (v) voted
  - package is older than 30 days and has been used in the last 30 days
  - ( now - install_time > 30 days ) and ( now - access_time < 30 days)
* (o) old
  - package is older than 30 days and hasn't been used recently
  - ( now - install_time > 30 days ) and ( now - access_time > 30 days)
* (n) no-files
  - there are no watched files present in the package
  - access_time = 0

Each package falls exactly into one category, so (n + r + v + o) is the total
number of the installed packages.

Popcorn is inspired by Debian Popcon available from http://popcon.debian.org/

Files
-----

popcorn-client
  * client-side written in Python
  * gathers info about packages and sends to server (either via e-mail or HTTP POST)
  * is called from cron every week (random time for each machine)

Submission format
-----------------

Format is simple plaintext. First line contains string POPCORN followed by the
popcorn version, machine architecture and uuid. Then the list of packages follows.
Each line represents one package, values are separated by space. First value is
one character describing the category (see Introduction), second value is the
package name, third and fourth are version and release, fifth and sixth
are architecture and repository of the package.

Plaintext size is around 100 KiB on casual machine, which could be later compressed
to around 20 KiB using HTTP gzip compression.

Format:

POPCORN <popcorn-client_version> <distro_name> <distro_version> <arch> <hw_uuid>
<category> <package> <version> <release> <epoch> <arch> <repository>
...
<EOF>

Watched files
-------------

To find out whether the package has been used recently, access times of the files
in the following directories are watched:

/bin
/boot
/lib
/lib64
/sbin
/usr/bin
/usr/games
/usr/include
/usr/lib
/usr/lib64
/usr/libexec
/usr/sbin

Note: if some of the filesystems are mounted with noatime, the packages
      from this filesystem are always in category 'no-files'
